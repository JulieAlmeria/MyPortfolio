                <p> 
          
                        A Colorado native, I'm thrilled to be currently enrolled in a full stack web development
                   bootcamp through the University of Denver. I'm looking to use my background
                   in arts and entertainment to develop unique, innovative, and user-friendly websites and applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  
                    I am half-Filipino, and first-generation American on my father's side.
                       Growing up, I was a regional champion Irish step-dancer and attended Denver School of the Arts, majoring in Theater.
                         I studied musical theater and dance at the American Musical & Dramatic Academy in NYC.
                          After a car accident hinderd my dancing abilities, I moved back to Denver in 2011 to join a funk band called Bop Skizzum. We won Westword Music Awards 3 years in a row, and got to play some awesome shows including support for Bad Rabbits, AWOLNation, Blink-182, Ozomatli, Fishbone, and the very first Riot Fest in Colorado.
                          
                            Another highlight of my music career has been performing at Colorado Rockies games, and singing the national anthem at Colorado Rapids and Denver Nuggets games.</li>
                            I now work as a lead singer with 3 different production companies in Denver, and serve as Board Secretary for the Denver Children's Choir.</li>
                            Recently, I released two 80s pop-inspired tracks produced by my friend, StayLoose.
                              My hobbies include kickboxing, reading novels, traveling, Netflix-and-Chilling, and going on adventures with my two year-old daughter, Ro.</li>
