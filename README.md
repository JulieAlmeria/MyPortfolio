This project will act as my professional portfolio for prospective employers to view so that they can get a feel for my style and capabilities. Intended to be responsive, this site will look great and maintain its usability across devices.
<h1>How to use</h1> 
<p>I attempted to make this site very user-friendly; you will find a helpful menu at the top of every page. From there, you can navigate between my biography (About), my portfolio (where you will eventually find links to previous projects of mine - for now, I'm using one completed site as placeholders for projects yet to be completed), and my contact page where you will be able to submit a message and send to me directly.</p>
<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>
<p>No installation required! Simply navigate to the following url to view: https://juliealmeria.github.io/ResponsivePortfolio/ </p>
